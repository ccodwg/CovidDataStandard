# Data and Metadata Standard for COVID-19 Data in Canada

The purpose of this repository is to collaborate on a data and metadata standard for COVID-19 data in Canada.

This standard is one component of the **[What Happened? COVID-19 in Canada](https://whathappened.coronavirus.icu/)** project. It will be used to support the [Timeline of COVID-19 in Canada](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada), which is an attempt to assemble a definitive COVID-19 dataset for Canada.
